This is a simulation of the tm1638 driver using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for
visualizing the signals. Complete documentation can be found in:
https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/

There are 3 basic steps here:

1. Compile the design into an executable file

  *** IMPORTANT ***

  The order the input files are opresented to the compiler matter!
  The consumers must be in the very end.

  iverilog -DSIMULATION -Wall -g2012 -o bin/tm1638_driver \
    design/tm1638_types.v \
    design/tm1638_driver_types.v \
    design/tm1638_driver.v \
    design/tm1638_stimulus.v \
    tb/tm1638_driver_tb.v

2. Run the simulation via the imulation run-time engine

  cd run; ../bintm1638_driver; cd ..

3. Visualize the waveforms

  gtkwave run/tm1638_driver.vcd
